Children are guilty of unpardonable rudeness when they spit on the face of a companion;
neither are they excusable who spit from windows or on walls or furniture.

St. Jean Baptist De La Salle is saying that children has no respect for anything
either People or Things. he is trying to say here is that the thing around us
wheter People or Things should be respected not just being judge by their appearance.
because you don't know what they been through and how much hard work they done.
Everyone needed respect and that is my Reaction to this.
