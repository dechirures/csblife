I Am John Dimitri De Jesus a BS-IT Game Design & Development student
of De La Salle - College of St. Benilde section GD1U. I have few roles
now im in college, one of them is study harder which is a common thing on a college student.
Perform even more in class discussions. I Have also new routines, one of them is
wake up early because of the time we need more to perform for class. Remove
my previous routines which is i don't study well because previously i always play games
and don't study because it get it bored, but now i change because i want to accomplish
being a GDD student because i don't want to waste the money of my parents
and this is really the course i want so i will work hard on it
and put a lot of effort. I also have new relations wtih friends
because you should now how to adjust to "fit in" so you
could become close friends. I have a lot of new assumptions
one of them is that College life is a difficult path if you don't put effort on it but
it's quite enjoyable to take becuse you will have new friends which you can
have a bond with. I also expected that the professors here are Brillant and can
increase our knowledge on certains topics. Thats are the changes happen
in my POV. When my life of college started
